## Smart Turn Detection

By default the cascaded pipeline uses Pipecat's ML-based [**Smart Turn**](https://docs.pipecat.ai/api-reference/server/utilities/turn-detection/smart-turn-overview) detection to decide when the user has finished speaking, so the agent replies promptly without cutting the user off. [Silero VAD](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/audio/silero-vad-analyzer) (`stop_secs=0.2`) detects the pause, and the Smart Turn model then judges whether the turn is actually complete. If the model still has not finalized after the Smart Turn silence fallback (default **1.0 s**, `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`), the turn completes anyway (fallback).

The Frontend/Backend Agent overrides the initial VAD pause to `2.0 s` and the
Smart Turn fallback to `2.0 s` to allow trailing words and follow-ups to arrive.
Its overrides are `FRONTEND_BACKEND_VAD_STOP_SECS` and
`FRONTEND_BACKEND_SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`; the latter has a minimum of `0.8 s`.
The longer VAD pause accommodates unfinished requests across speech gaps and
adds end-of-turn latency. It does not change the separate barge-in start
thresholds. Other examples retain the shared defaults above.

Smart Turn controls when a user turn ends. It does not decide whether a sound
starts a barge-in. The Generic Frontend/Backend Agent uses Pipecat's bot-aware
minimum-word start strategy: while the bot is speaking, at least 2 transcribed
words must arrive before the pipeline interrupts bot audio. When the bot is not
speaking, 1 transcribed word can start a normal turn. This threshold prevents a
single stray automatic speech recognition token from cutting off a response.
The server records accepted interruptions through the
`user-interruption-trigger` event and `user_interruption_trigger` log, including
a bounded transcript and word count.

### How It Works

1. The user speaks, and ASR emits interim transcripts as audio streams in.
2. Silero VAD detects a pause in speech. On each `VADUserStoppedSpeakingFrame`, the local NVIDIA STT subclass sends an 80 ms PCM silence chunk when the ASR stream is active. The chunk matches the configured audio channel count and includes the NVIDIA runtime configuration `force_eou=true`. If the ASR stream reconnects before sending the chunk, the subclass preserves its queued `force_eou` marker for the new stream.
3. When NVIDIA returns `is_final`, stock `NvidiaSTTService` response handling emits `TranscriptionFrame(finalized=True)`.
4. The Smart Turn model analyzes the recent audio and classifies the turn as **complete** or **incomplete**. If it is incomplete but silence continues past the Smart Turn stop threshold (default 1.0 s, `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`), the turn completes anyway (fallback).
5. Pipecat's stock turn analyzer strategy combines the local semantic decision with ASR transcript readiness. Native ASR finalization alone does not replace local turn detection. After the turn closes, the transcript goes to the LLM and TTS streams the reply.

The VAD-stop finalization is an early transcript yield; it does not close the
semantic user turn. If the user resumes speaking, VAD starts a new speech
segment and repeats the sequence.

NVIDIA `force_eou` finalization requires a supported cache-aware recurrent
neural network transducer (RNNT) model, such as a Nemotron ASR Streaming
model. Unsupported models ignore `force_eou` and instead use ASR endpointing.
Generic and Multilingual configure `stop_history=400`, which finalizes after
400 ms of trailing silence. The Frontend/Backend Agent uses `stop_history=-1`
to retain native Nemotron Speech model defaults. Native ASR final frames can
arrive before the local VAD stop event; the sequence above describes their
roles rather than requiring that arrival order.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `USE_SILERO_VAD_TURN_DETECTION` | `false` | Keep `false` for Smart Turn. Set `true` to disable it and use pure Silero VAD end-of-utterance detection instead. |
| `SILERO_VAD_STOP_SECS` | `0.5` | Silence (seconds) before end-of-utterance. Applies **only** in pure-VAD mode (`USE_SILERO_VAD_TURN_DETECTION=true`). |
| `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS` | `1.0` | Smart Turn silence fallback (seconds) before the turn completes without a `COMPLETE` classification. Applies **only** in Smart Turn mode (`USE_SILERO_VAD_TURN_DETECTION=false`). |

> On the shared Smart Turn path, a `0.2 s` Silero VAD pause (`stop_secs=0.2`) first detects the silence. The Smart Turn model then gets up to the configured fallback period (default `1.0 s`, `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`) to finalize the turn. Only `SILERO_VAD_STOP_SECS` is ignored in Smart Turn mode. The `generic-assistant/server-perf` profile forces pure Silero VAD (`USE_SILERO_VAD_TURN_DETECTION=true`, `SILERO_VAD_STOP_SECS=0.5`) for lower-overhead load testing.

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [`SileroVADAnalyzer`](https://docs.pipecat.ai/server/utilities/audio/silero-vad-analyzer) | Voice activity detection with a configurable silence threshold |
| [Smart Turn](https://docs.pipecat.ai/api-reference/server/utilities/turn-detection/smart-turn-overview) (default) | ML end-of-utterance detection for natural turn-taking (`LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3`, fallback `stop_secs` default `1.0`, `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`) |
| `SpeechTimeoutUserTurnStopStrategy` | End-of-turn strategy used **only** in pure-VAD mode (`USE_SILERO_VAD_TURN_DETECTION=true`). Ends the turn on a VAD silence timeout instead of the Smart Turn model |

The [Omni examples](../../src/examples/omni_assistant/README.md) run ASR inside the model, so no upstream `TranscriptionFrame` exists when Smart Turn completes. They use Pipecat's `TurnAnalyzerUserTurnStopStrategy` with `wait_for_transcript=False` and a `VADUserTurnStartStrategy`. This setting lets the same [Smart Turn](https://docs.pipecat.ai/api-reference/server/utilities/turn-detection/smart-turn-overview) model (`LocalSmartTurnAnalyzerV3`, fallback `stop_secs` default `1.0`, `SMART_TURN_STOP_SECS`) finalize the audio-only turn without waiting for a transcript.

## Chat History Limit

Every turn appends to the LLM's context. Left unbounded, that context keeps growing, which raises latency (more tokens to process means a higher time-to-first-token), increases cost, and eventually overflows the model's context window. For real-time voice, a small, bounded context is what keeps replies fast. Pipecat manages history through its [context aggregators](https://docs.pipecat.ai/guides/learn/context-management) and built-in [context summarization](https://docs.pipecat.ai/pipecat/fundamentals/context-summarization). The examples wire a **turn-count** window (`CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS`) on top for a predictable per-turn budget.

We use context summarization logic for our examples to always **pin the initial prompt / system messages** loaded at session start. Nemotron's chat template carries the assistant instructions and tool definitions in the *user* section, so those must stay verbatim. Evicting them (as a token-based window might) would degrade tool-calling and persona. Only the older **conversational** turns are trimmed, and the handling differs by example:

- **Generic** and **Multilingual** assistants **summarize** older history: once the conversation grows past the recent window, the older turns are condensed into a single pinned summary message (an additional LLM call after the turn), and the most recent `CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS` turns are kept verbatim.
- **Frontend/Backend Agent** uses a plain **sliding window**: it keeps the most recent `CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS` user turns, including their assistant messages and tool results. It drops older complete turns and preserves the initial prompts.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS` | `10` (Generic / Multilingual), `20` (Frontend/Backend Agent) | Most recent non-prompt turns kept before older history is summarized (Generic/Multilingual) or dropped (Frontend/Backend Agent) |

```bash
# Override the per-example default (applies to whichever example is running)
CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS=10
```

The Generic Frontend/Backend domain also has a separate delegated history
window: `BACKEND_HISTORY_TURN_LIMIT` defaults to `8` user turns, including the
current request and associated assistant text, and accepts `1`–`20`.
Session configuration can override it with `backend_history_turn_limit`.
If a positive native Talker window is smaller, the pipeline raises it to the
backend limit. Zero or negative native-window values still disable trimming.
The backend remains bounded to 32,000 content characters and 128 messages.
Refer to [backend follow-up context](configure-frontend-backend-domains.md#follow-up-context-and-fresh-results)
for turn grouping, the Astra control, and oversized-message behavior.

### How It Works

When the recent-turn window exceeds `CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS`:

1. Initial prompt messages loaded at session start are always preserved.
2. The most recent `CHAT_HISTORY_RECENT_TURNS` turns are kept verbatim.
3. Older non-prompt turns are **summarized into one pinned summary message** (Generic / Multilingual) or **removed** (Frontend/Backend Agent).

### Recommendations

| Use Case | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Standard conversations | `10`–`20` |
| Multilingual mode | `5-10` |

## Audio Output Buffering

`AUDIO_OUT_10MS_CHUNKS` sets how many 10 ms audio frames the server batches per outbound send (the output buffer depth). The default is `5` (50 ms) for WebRTC and `10` (100 ms) for WebSocket.

```bash
# In .env: override the transport default
AUDIO_OUT_10MS_CHUNKS=10
```

- **WebRTC, `5` (50 ms):** lowest latency.
- **WebSocket, `10` (100 ms):** smoother over a plain stream.
- **High concurrency, `10`–`40` (100–400 ms):** prevents glitches under load.

**Why buffer, and why more for WebSocket.** WebRTC ships its own jitter buffer and paces media for you, so a small buffer stays glitch-free at low latency. A raw WebSocket stream has no media-layer jitter buffer (frames ride a plain TCP connection), so under network jitter or many concurrent sessions, too-small chunks starve the client and you hear gaps or crackle. A larger buffer absorbs that variance, trading a little added latency for stable playback. Raise it further as concurrency grows.

**Telephony / server-side: send in bursts.** When the consumer is a telephony gateway (SIP/PSTN) or another server that does its own buffering and pacing, real-time chunking on our side only adds latency. Use a custom transport to send audio as soon as it is generated, and let the downstream handle playout timing.

**Barge-in trade-off.** Buffering works against fast barge-in: when the user interrupts, audio already queued downstream keeps playing until it drains, so the bot talks over the user for up to the buffer's duration. The bigger the buffer, the longer that tail. For low barge-in latency with a large buffer, the client must **flush its playback queue** on interruption (drop the buffered audio) rather than play it out. Custom and telephony clients (typically on the WebSocket path) should implement this flush.

## Uvicorn Worker Scaling

`UVICORN_WORKERS` controls how many `uvicorn` worker processes accept incoming sessions.

```bash
# .env or container env
UVICORN_WORKERS=<workers>
```

Keep `UVICORN_WORKERS=1` for local development or a personal assistant. For cloud deployments and scaling experiments, use a higher value. For the recommended scaling deployment shape and its companion tuning values, see [Reproducing the recommended scaling setup](../../benchmarking_tools/scaling-perf/README.md#reproducing-the-recommended-scaling-setup).

When `UVICORN_WORKERS > 1`, **session-config-based WebRTC and WebSocket flows are disabled** because that state is process-local. For multi-worker deployments, use one of these patterns:

- keep a **single worker** if you depend on per-process session config
- use **sticky routing** so a session stays on the same worker
- move session state into **shared storage**

## Transport Selection

The server supports both WebRTC and WebSocket transports simultaneously on different endpoints:

| Transport | Endpoint | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **WebRTC** | `POST /api/offer` | Production voice interactions, lowest latency |
| **WebSocket** | `WS /api/ws` | Telephony / server-side integrations, testing, firewall-restricted environments, simpler deployments |

**For telephony (SIP/PSTN) and server-to-server use cases, use the WebSocket endpoint.** It streams raw audio frames you can bridge to a gateway or another service. WebRTC is best for direct browser clients, where its built-in jitter buffering and NAT traversal give the lowest latency.

### Choosing which transports are exposed

Both transports are exposed by default and the browser UI picks one. To restrict the server to a single transport, set `transports` in [`examples_registry.yaml`](../../examples_registry.yaml) or override it at runtime with the `TRANSPORT_SELECTION` environment variable (the env var wins):

| Value | Exposes |
|-------|---------|
| `all` (default) | WebRTC and WebSocket |
| `webrtc` | WebRTC only |
| `websocket` | WebSocket only |

```bash
# .env: e.g. expose only WebSocket for a telephony / server-side deployment
TRANSPORT_SELECTION=websocket
```
